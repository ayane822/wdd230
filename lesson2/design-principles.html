            This website represents repetition because they are repeating a single element many times in a design.
            In each box, there are the same color, fonts, lines, and sizes. 
            It helps users understand how interactive elements work.

        <p class="sentence2">
            This website represents "White Space and Clean design" because 
            they have empty space around the content and functional elements of a page. 
            It is effective because it doesn't overwhelm the designs and the contents. 
            In addition to this, white space lets your designs breathe 
            by reducing the amount of text and functional elements that users see at once.

        <p class="sentence3">
            This website represents "Rule of Thirds" because the main design which is two persons in the picture 
            places in the right third of the images. 
            It is also an essential way to express because it helps draw the viewer's eye 
            into the image and places more emphasis on the subject.
